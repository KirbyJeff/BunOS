# BunOS
## This is the official BunOS Linux Distro Repo, hosting the ISO and Installation guides and resources
BunOS is a Ubuntu 22.04-derived OS for amd64 Computers, done as a side project literally in 2 weeks total, I did this to expand my knowledge of linux and to have something I can say "Wow, I Did This!" about.
# My Inspiration
BunOS is named for my catto, Loki, whom I nicknamed Bun because he looks like a hamburger bun when curled up.
[Here is Loki](./images/Loki.jpg)
