## Bare Metal
### Diclaimer
Be sure to back up everything important on your computer that you are installing this on as ALL DATA WILL BE WIPED ON THE INSTALL MEDIA (USB DRIVE) AND INSTALL LOCATION (INTERNAL COMPUTER HARD DRIVE(S))
### Step 1: Downloading
You will want to get [7-ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/) (make sure it is the correct one for your system), run the downloaded .exe,make sure all files (*.001, *.002, *.003, *.004, and *.005) are in same folder with original names, select all five files (ctrl+click on each), right click, under 7-Zip click extract, 7-zip will automatically extract and put together the original .iso file, keep the .iso file, you will need it for installation. 
### Step 2: Rufus
Download Rufus from [The Rufus Official Site](https://rufus.ie/) and install it same as 7-Zip, Open it, insert a usb drive of your choice, Note: it needs to be 64GB or larger for best outcome, ALL DATA WILL BE ERASED WHEN YOU FLASH THE ISO USING RUFUS OR ANY OTHER TOOL, PLEASE BACK IT UP FOR YOUR SAKE, In Rufus Under "Device", choose you usb drive from the list, Under "Boot Selection" choose "Disk or ISO image (Please Select)" and press "SELECT" Note: If it says "DOWNLOAD", then click the arrow next to it to find "SELECT", and navigate to your .iso you extracted earlier, select "Open" and wait for it to load, it may go by so fast you dont notice, If you see Image Options, DO NOT SELECT "Standard Windows Installation", Leave the Partition scheme, Target system, and Cluster size options alone, File system if availiable should be "ext4" if you don't see that option do not mess with it, feel free to add a custom label, whatever you want it to be, Inside the Show advanced format options menu, you'll see a number of...yes, format options! You can leave all of them in their default state, but you're welcome to select Check device for bad blocks if you're concerned the device you're using may have an issue. Choose 1 pass or if you think there is an issue with the usb drive, more than one pass, Click "Start" at the bottom of the screen to start the flashing process, DO NOT TAKE OUT THE USB DRIVE, IT WILL PERMANANTLY DAMAGE THE DRIVE, wait until it is done flashing, you will know when it says "READY" at the bottom.
### Step 3: Installing
Note: A mobile phone may be useful to some users from this point on. Take out the USB Drive and power off the computer you intend to install it on,plug in the USB DRIVE and push the power button to turn it on and QUICKLY START RAPIDLY PRESSING THE F2 OR DELETE (DEL) KEYS to enter BIOS, find your boot options and set the first boot priority to the USB DRIVE, Save your BIOS SETTINGS and EXIT Your computer should boot to the BunOS Homescreen it will look very different from the one in the images folder in this repo that is because you have yet to customize it, customize however you wish, Note: this is not installed yet, this is a liveboot session, to install click the icon in the taskbar that has a harddrive with a orange circle on it, and follow the instructions there, but please try it before you install it.
## WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
### Installing on WSL
Installing on WSL is significantly Easier than Bare Metal but is only available on windows 10 or 11
### Step 1: Requirements
Select all .00* files and right click after installing 7-Zip under 7-zip click extract and 7zip will create bun-os.tar or similar. First you will need to open "Turn Windows Features On or Off" and enable "Virtual Machine Platform", DO NOT ENABLE "WSL" IT IS OUTDATED, instead go to [The WSL Github](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/releases) and download the latest asset with the ".msixbundle" file extension, IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE, and after it is downloaded go to downloads and double click it, Windows will ask "do you want to install this app", click yes or if you don't see yes click more info and click run anyway, This is made by microsoft so it is garunteed safe. Once it is installed, search in taskbar "cmd" and click "run as administrator" on windows command prompt. Run the command (no quotes) "wsl --version" if it says you need to install optional features run "wsl --install --no-distribution" and wait until it says C:\Windows\System32\> again, then run "wsl --version" again it should say "2.x.x.x" somewhere in the output, close everything and shut down the computer, Boot into BIOS by pushing the power button and holding F2 or DELETE (DEL) and under CPU settings find virtualization settings and enable it. Note: It may be named different in your BIOS for example my BIOS called it SVM Mode. Save and Exit, it should boot into windows and everything will look the same, download the zip files labeled wsl and extract with 7-Zip and import bun-os.tar into wsl with administrator command prompt running "wsl --import Bun-OS <install_location> <downloads_location>\bun-os.tar" where <install_location> is a folder where you want to install it, and <downloads_location> is where bun-os.tar is located, should be C:\Users\%Username%\Downloads\bun-os.tar, to start, run "wsl Bun-OS"
